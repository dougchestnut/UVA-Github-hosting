							## What is GitHub?
							> GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

							## What is Git?
							> As Git is a distributed version control system, it can be used as a server out of the box. Dedicated Git server software helps, amongst other features, to add access control, display the contents of a Git repository via the web, and help managing multiple repositories. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Wikipedia</a>

						<h2>Terms</h2>
						<p>A <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository" target="_blank">repository</a> is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Terms (cont.)</h2>
						<p>A <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#branch" target="_blank">branch</a> is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Terms (cont.)</h2>
						<p>A repository's default branch is called "master". As you initially make commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Terms (cont.)</h2>
						<p>A <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/" target="_blank">fork</a> is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.</p>
					</section>

						<h2>Terms (cont.)</h2>
						<p>A <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit" target="_new">commit</a> to a in Git simply records/saves changed to a Git repository.</p>

					<section>
						<h2><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/#so-what-is-jekyll-exactly" target="_blank">So what is Jekyll, exactly?</a></h2>
						<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and a Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server (or GitHub's in our case).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Jekyll Structure</h2>
						<p>Jekyll looks to your <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/" target="_blank">directory and file sturcture</a> to determine how to build a static Web Site<p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Jekyll Plugins</h2>
						<p>Jekyll has a plugin system with hooks that allow you to create custom generated content specific to your site. You can run custom code for your site without having to modify the Jekyll source itself.</p>
						<p>GitHub has a <a href="https://pages.github.com/versions/" target="_blank">predefined set</a> of plugins that you can use, outside of those you will have to build your site locally before committing it to GitHub.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Jekyll Configuration</h2>
						<p>Jekyll allows you to concoct your sites in any way you can dream up, and it’s thanks to the powerful and flexible <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/" target="_blank">configuration options</a> that this is possible. These options can either be specified in a _config.yml file placed in your site’s root directory, or can be specified as flags for the jekyll executable in the terminal.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Jekyll Posts</h2>
						<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/" target="_blank">Jekyll posts</a> are either html or markdown files stored in the _posts directory.<p>
						<p>Posts need to have their date and title in the filename like so: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</p>
						<p>Posts also are required to have <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/" target="_blank">'Front Matter'</a> which is YAML defined in the top of the file</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Jekyll Pages</h2>
						<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/" target="_blank">Jekyll Pages</a> use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/" target="_blank">'Front Matter'</a> to define page layout.</p>

						<p>You can tell GitHub to completely bypass Jekyll processing on your Pages by creating a file named .nojekyll in the root of your pages directory.</p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment"><a href="https://github.com/dougchestnut/UVA-Github-hosting" target="_blank">This presentation</a> is an example of that!</li>
