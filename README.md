# Websites with GitHub and Jekyll 

Would you like to build a website but are unsure where to host it? GitHub, known best as a version control system, is also a hosting service. Join us to learn about GitHub’s hosting capabilities, as well as how to create your own static website using Jekyll and a set of web platform APIs called Web Components. You’ll leave this interactive session knowing how to use these tools to launch your own site! You’ll need a github.com account to participate. An understanding of basic HTML and markdown is helpful.
